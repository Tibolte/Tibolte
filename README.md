### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Thibault, I'm a mobile developer who worked for startups in Iceland and Australia. Nowadays, I mostly do Android development, but I had a crack at Backend development recently with Go, kTor and Spring. I also do iOS development in my spare time and publish cool things on Github.
