### G'day ðŸ‘‹

My name's Thibault, I'm a mobile developer who worked for startups in Iceland and Australia. Nowadays, I mostly do heaps of Android development, but I sometimes have a crack at Backend development with kTor and Spring. I also play with iOS development in my spare time and publish cool things on Github.
